2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. Flow Functionality Types and Flow Numbering. There are three types of flow functionality:

		2.1.1. Infrastructure
		2.1.2. User-related
		2.1.3. Analyst-related
		
		2.1.4. Each type of flow functionality is assigned a range of numbers:

			2.1.4.1. Infrastructure flows: flow-0
			2.1.4.2. User-related flows: flow-1 to flow-49
			2.1.4.3. Analyst-related flows: flow-50 to flow-99

		2.1.4.5. Flow numbers start with 0 and increment by 1. For example, flow-0 is the first infrastructure flow, flow-1 is the first user-related flow, and flow-50 is the first analyst-related flow.

		2.1.4.6. Infrastructure flow has only one flow number, but it has multiple blocks. For example, infrastructure flow-0 has blocks 3, 6, 9, and so on.

		2.1.4.7. User-related flows and analyst-related flows have their own range of flow numbers. There are no overlapping flow numbers between the different types of flow functionality.
