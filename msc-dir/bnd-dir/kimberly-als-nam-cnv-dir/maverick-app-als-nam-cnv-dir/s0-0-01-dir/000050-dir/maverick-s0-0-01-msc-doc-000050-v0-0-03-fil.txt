2. Example list:

	2.1. An alternative identifier for Sambar, LeBar and BOTops is also known as an alias name. It is a substitute name used to refer to a backend resource or subject in the web applications. Alias names are used to simplify the process of referring to resources, especially when the resource's full name is long or complex. They can also be used to make it easier to share resources between different teams or applications. 

		2.1.1. Example one: In the case of the jGraph, the alias name "shreyaGhosha" is shorter and more descriptive than the long name "1120-10-40510-abb-blk-dev-aws-dbr-pre-jsn-obj-v0-0-01-lvl30-010-fil.json". This name is therefore easier to remember and refer to in documentation. Additionally, the name "shreyaGhosha" provides some context about the jGraph, which can help readers to understand the purpose of the resource. 

		2.1.2. Example two: In the case of the BOTops web application, using the alias name "flarzia" instead of "botops-1120-10-igw-dev" for the Internet Gateway has several benefits: improved readability, reduced complexity, meaningful representation, error prevention, and accessibility for non-programmers.

		2.1.3. Example three: Using an alias name for the manifest file like "glemzea" would be much easier when deploying the file "1320-10-11815-jcr-mnf-dev-aws-sub-fil.yaml" to the EKS cluster to create a subnet. This is because alias names are shorter and more descriptive, making them easier to remember and use. Additionally, alias names can help to prevent errors, as they are less likely to be misspelled or mistyped.

		2.1.4. Example four: Using an alias name "sluxpin" stored in tags of the VPC subnet "eks-botops-1b-jcr-1320-10-sub-dev" is a much better and easier way to describe the resource. 

		2.1.5. Example five: Employing the alias name "matrixrun" instead of the full complex name of the microservice "registration-usr-brd-no-us-en-lo-3040-10-msv-smd" is a much more effective and efficient approach.

	2.2. An alias name or an alternative identifier for Sambar, LeBar, or BOTops serves as a more user-friendly substitute name that facilitates referencing a specific resource or subject.

	2.26. Rules for constructing clear and consistent alias names for resources and subjects:

		2.26.1. Rule one: In the context of Sambar, LeBar and BOTops, using lowercase for all types of resource alias names promotes consistency, readability, and ease of understanding across the codebase. These alias names are employed in various aspects of the development process, including resource names, configurations, scripts, and documentation. The web applications follow the convention of using camel case for the alias names of jGraph, dBLOCKr, and uBLOCKr. This is consistent with the general recommendation for creating more specific alias names, which helps to improve readability and maintainability of code.
