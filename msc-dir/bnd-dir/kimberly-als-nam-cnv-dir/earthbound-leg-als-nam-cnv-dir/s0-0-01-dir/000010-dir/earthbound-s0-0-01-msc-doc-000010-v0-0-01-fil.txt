3. Understanding and Utilizing Alias Names Effectively in Sambar, LeBar and BOTops Application

	3.1. Rules for constructing clear and consistent alias names for resources and subjects:

		3.1.1. Rule one: In the context of Sambar, LeBar and BOTops, using lowercase for all types of resource alias names promotes consistency, readability, and ease of understanding across the codebase. These alias names are employed in various aspects of the development process, including resource names, configurations, scripts, and documentation. The web applications follow the convention of using camel case for the alias names of jGraph, dBLOCKr, and uBLOCKr. This is consistent with the general recommendation for creating more specific alias names, which helps to improve readability and maintainability of code.

		3.1.2. Rule two: Using hyphens to separate words in resource alias names that consist of two or more words enhances readability and maintainability of the code. This approach aligns with the general practice of using hyphens to connect compound words and clarify their meaning. For instance, "druvial-clerfane" is more visually distinct and easier to comprehend than "druvialclerfane".

		3.1.3. Rule three: Follow the specific theme. This rule ensures that alias names are consistent with the overall theme of the Sambar, LeBar and BOTops application. For example, if the application is themed around animals, then alias names might include "dog-space" and "cat-hero".

		3.1.4. Rule four: Enforcing uniqueness for alias names across all resources in the Sambar, LeBar, and BOTops web applications is crucial for maintaining a consistent and well-organized codebase. This requirement ensures that each resource can be uniquely identified by its alias name, preventing conflicts and potential errors.
