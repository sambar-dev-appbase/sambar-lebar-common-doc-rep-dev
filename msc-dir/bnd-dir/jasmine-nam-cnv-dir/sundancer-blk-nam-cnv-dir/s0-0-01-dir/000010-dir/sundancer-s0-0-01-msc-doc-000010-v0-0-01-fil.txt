2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. Block Naming Convention: The naming convention for blocks follows a similar principle to flows, but it delves into smaller, more granular aspects of the functionality. For instance, the Sambar User Registration flow consists of five distinct blocks:

		2.1.1. Assign Account Number, Save Registration Images to S3 Bucket, Get Subscription Plan Values from DynamoDB Table.

		2.1.2. Save User Details to DynamoDB Table, Register User into Cognito Pool.

		2.1.3. Validate and Update Invitation Code, Save User Details from Join Now Form.

		2.1.4. Save User Metadata to MySQL Tables, Save User Registration Payload to S3 Bucket.

		2.1.5. Send SMS Notification, Send Email, Save SMS Log to DynamoDB Table.

		2.1.6. These blocks represent individual steps within the overall user registration process, providing a more structured and organized approach to naming conventions.
