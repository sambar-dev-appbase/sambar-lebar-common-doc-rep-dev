2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The naming convention for IAM users in the context of the Sambar, LeBar, and BOTops web applications is designed to clearly reflect the relationship between the resources involved. It adheres to a structured approach based on the concept of "start resource" and "end resource," where the start resource initiates actions on the end resource.

	2.2. Start Resource: The start resource is a microservice, which is a service designed to perform a specific function. Microservices are organized into a layered architecture, with the top layer consisting of microservices and the bottom layer consisting of databases and storage resources.

	2.3. End Resource: The end resource is a database or storage component. Databases are used to store and manage data, while storage resources are used to store files and other objects.

	2.4. The naming scheme for IAM users reflects the relationship between the start resource and the end resource. The name of an IAM user includes the following components:

		2.4.1. Start Resource Identifier: This identifies the microservice that initiates the actions.

		2.4.2. End Resource Identifier: This identifies the database or storage component that is accessed.

		2.4.3. IAM User Classifier: The classifier "user" explicitly indicates that the resource is an IAM user.

		2.4.4. Read/Write Indicator: A one-letter code, either "r" for read or "w" for write, indicates the type of access granted by the user.

		2.4.5. Environment Two- or Three-Digit Code: This specifies the environment in which the IAM user resides, such as Sambar Development (sd2), LeBar Development (ld), or BOTops Development (dev), facilitating data isolation and management.

		2.4.6. Example: The IAM user named "ua0203-no-us-en-sd2-lo-user-account-number-0203-r-user-sd2" indicates that the microservice "ua0203-no-us-en-sd2-lo" has permission to read ("r") data from the database "user-account-number-0203-sd2". This naming scheme clearly conveys the relationship between the two resources and facilitates easy identification of IAM users.

		2.4.7. Additional Characteristics: In addition to the resource identifiers and read/write indicator, IAM users also incorporate two-digit environment codes, such as "sd2" for Sambar Development, to specify the environment in which the IAM users reside. This code helps in maintaining data isolation and management, ensuring that IAM users' usage aligns with the intended environment.

		2.4.8. The naming convention for IAM users in the Sambar, LeBar, and BOTops web applications is designed to be clear, concise, and informative. It reflects the relationship between the resources involved, facilitates easy identification of IAM users, and promotes consistent naming practices, thereby enhancing overall network management and security.
