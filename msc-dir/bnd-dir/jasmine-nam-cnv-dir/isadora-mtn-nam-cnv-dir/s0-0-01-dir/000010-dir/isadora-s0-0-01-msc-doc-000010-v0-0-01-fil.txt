2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The naming convention for MySQL tables is based on the type of data they store, ensuring clear identification and organization. Each table name incorporates several characteristics that provide additional context and granularity.

	2.2. MySQL Table Name Composition: The MySQL table name is derived from the primary type of data it holds. For example, the MySQL table named "user-account-number" explicitly conveys that it stores user account numbers.
