2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The naming convention for ACLs in the context of the Sambar, LeBar, and BOTops web applications is designed to reflect the relationship between the resources involved. It follows a structure based on the concept of "start resource" and "end resource", where the start resource initiates actions on the end resource.

	2.2. Start Resource: The start resource is a microservice, which is a service that is designed to perform a specific function. Microservices are often organized into a layered architecture, with the top layer consisting of microservices and the bottom layer consisting of databases and storage components.

	2.3. End Resource: The end resource is a database or storage component. Databases are used to store and manage data, while storage components are used to store files and other objects.

	2.4. Naming Scheme: The naming scheme for ACLs reflects the relationship between the start resource and the end resource. The name of an ACL includes the following components:

		2.4.1. Start resource identifier: This identifies the microservice that initiates the actions.
		2.4.2. End resource identifier: This identifies the database or storage component that is accessed.
		2.4.3. ACL classifier: The classifier "acl" explicitly indicates that the resource is an ACL.
		2.4.4. Example: The ACL named "ua0203-no-us-en-sd2-lo-user-account-number-0203-acl-sd2" indicates that the microservice "ua0203-no-us-en-sd2-lo" has permission to access the database "user-account-number-0203-sd2." This naming scheme clearly conveys the relationship between the two resources and facilitates easy identification of ACLs.

	2.5. Additional Characteristics: In addition to the resource identifiers, ACLs also incorporate the "acl" classifier to explicitly indicate their type. This classifier serves as a clear identifier for the resource type and aligns with the naming convention for other infrastructure components.

	2.6. The naming convention for ACLs in the Sambar, LeBar, and BOTops web applications is designed to be clear, concise, and informative. It reflects the relationship between the resources involved and facilitates easy identification of ACLs.
