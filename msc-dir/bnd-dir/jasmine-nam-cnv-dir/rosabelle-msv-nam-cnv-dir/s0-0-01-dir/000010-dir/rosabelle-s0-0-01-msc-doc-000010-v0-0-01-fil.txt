2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The naming convention for microservices is primarily driven by the type of functionality they provide. For instance, microservices such as "user-authentication," "user-invitation," and "user-sms-notification" reflect their specific functional areas.

	2.2. This naming approach extends beyond the main functionality to encompass additional characteristics that aid in identifying and classifying microservices. These characteristics include:

		2.2.1. Block and Flow Number Four- or Five-Digit Code: These identifiers differentiate between individual blocks and flows within the microservice, providing a granular level of organization.

		2.2.2. Subscription Plan Two-Digit Code: This attribute indicates the subscription plan associated with the microservice, ensuring alignment with the pricing structure.

		2.2.3. Country Two-Digit Code: This code specifies the country or region targeted by the microservice, enabling regional targeting and customization.

		2.2.4. Language Two-Digit Code: This code identifies the primary language supported by the microservice, facilitating localization and language-specific adaptations.

		2.2.5. Environment Two- or Three-Digit Code: This code denotes the environment in which the microservice operates, such as production, staging, or development.

		2.2.6. Cloud Provider Two-Digit Code: This code identifies the cloud provider where the microservice is hosted, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.
