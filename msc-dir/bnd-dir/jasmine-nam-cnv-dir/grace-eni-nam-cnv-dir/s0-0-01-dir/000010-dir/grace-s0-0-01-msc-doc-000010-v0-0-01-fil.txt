2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The naming convention for elastic network interfaces follows a structured approach that provides clear identification and context for their purpose within the infrastructure. This approach utilizes specific characteristics to enhance differentiation and understanding:

		2.1.1. Elastic Network Interface Classifier: The classifier "eni" is explicitly included in the name to clearly indicate the resource type. This classification ensures consistency and facilitates easy identification of elastic network interfaces among other infrastructure resources.

		2.1.2. Associated Resource Name: The name of the associated resource, such as an RDS database or an EC2 instance, is incorporated into the elastic network interface name. This provides context and clearly identifies the resource or service that the elastic network interface supports.

		2.1.3. Environment Two- or Three-Digit Environment Code: An environment two- or three-digit code, such as "sd2" for Sambar Development, is incorporated into the elastic network interface name to specify the environment in which the elastic network interface resides. This code helps in maintaining data isolation and management, ensuring that elastic network interface usage aligns with the intended environment.

		2.1.4. By incorporating these characteristics, the elastic network interface naming convention provides a clear and structured approach to identifying and managing elastic network interfaces within the infrastructure. This naming scheme promotes consistent naming practices and enhances overall network management.
