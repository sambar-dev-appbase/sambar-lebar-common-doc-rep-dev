2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The "BKT" classifier is a specialized text classification algorithm designed to identify and classify various types of buckets in the backend, including Amazon S3 buckets, Google Cloud Storage buckets, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage containers. It operates by analyzing the textual content associated with bucket descriptions, configuration details, and related documentation, extracting key features and patterns to determine the appropriate bucket type, attributes, and access control mechanisms. The classifier's effectiveness stems from its ability to distinguish between diverse bucket functionalities, storage policies, and access control rules.

	2.2. The "BKT" classifier plays a crucial role in identifying and classifying various types of buckets and their corresponding attributes. Its capabilities extend beyond mere categorization, encompassing the ability to discern subtle nuances in bucket access control mechanisms, storage policies, and usage contexts. The classifier's proficiency in this domain stems from its comprehensive understanding of cloud storage architectures, object storage principles, and domain-specific terminology, enabling it to accurately classify a broad spectrum of bucket entities, including:

	2.4. The "BKT" classifier's implementation relies on a combination of natural language processing techniques, cloud storage terminology analysis tools, and machine learning algorithms. The classifier first extracts relevant features from the textual content associated with a bucket or bucket-related resource. These features may include bucket descriptions, configuration details, access control policies, and cloud storage-specific terminology. Next, the classifier analyzes the extracted features in the context of cloud architectures, object storage principles, and domain-specific usage patterns. Finally, the classifier employs machine learning algorithms to classify the bucket or bucket-related resource based on the combined textual, structural, contextual, and domain-specific features.

	2.5. The "BKT" classifier offers several advantages over traditional bucket classification methods:

		2.5.1. High Accuracy: The classifier achieves high accuracy in classifying diverse bucket types and their associated attributes, minimizing misclassifications and false positives.

		2.5.2. Deep Domain Expertise: The classifier incorporates deep cloud storage domain knowledge, enabling it to understand the nuances and complexities of bucket configurations, access control mechanisms, and storage policies.

		2.5.3. Context Awareness: The classifier considers the contextual information surrounding buckets and bucket-related resources, providing more refined and context-aware classifications.
