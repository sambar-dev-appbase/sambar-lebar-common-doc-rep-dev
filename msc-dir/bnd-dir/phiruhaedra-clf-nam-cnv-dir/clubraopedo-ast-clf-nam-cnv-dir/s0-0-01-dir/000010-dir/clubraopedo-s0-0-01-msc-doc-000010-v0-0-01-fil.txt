2. Subject Introduction:

	2.1. The "AST" classifier is a specialized text classification algorithm designed to identify and classify various types of assets and their associated backend resources. It operates by analyzing the textual content associated with asset descriptions, configuration details, and related documentation, extracting key features and patterns to determine the appropriate asset type, attributes, and backend resource requirements. The classifier's effectiveness stems from its ability to distinguish between diverse asset functionalities, resource dependencies, and deployment environments.

	2.2. In the context of asset classification, an asset is defined as a logical grouping of backend resources that are deployed and managed together to fulfill a specific function or provide a specific service. Backend resources, also known as infrastructure resources or underlying components, are the fundamental building blocks of assets. They represent the physical or virtual resources that are provisioned and configured to support the operation of an asset.

	2.3. The AST classifier recognizes that assets are not isolated entities; they are tightly coupled with their backend resources. The existence of an asset depends on the availability and proper configuration of its associated backend resources. For instance, a MySQL database asset cannot function without its underlying components, such as ACLs, security groups, subnet groups, subnets, RDS clusters, MySQL databases, and MySQL tables.

	2.4. The AST classifier plays a crucial role in identifying and classifying assets based on their backend resource dependencies. It goes beyond mere categorization and delves into the intricate relationships between assets and their underlying components. The classifier's proficiency in this domain stems from its comprehensive understanding of cloud computing architectures, resource management principles, and domain-specific terminology, enabling it to accurately classify a broad spectrum of asset entities and their associated backend resources.

	2.5. The AST classifier effectively classifies asset types, attributes, and backend resources. Asset types represent the different categories of assets, such as virtual machines, containers, serverless functions, and databases. Asset attributes provide granular insights into the characteristics of an asset, such as CPU cores, memory allocation, storage capacity, and operating system. Backend resources encompass the underlying components that support an asset's operation, including network configurations, security policies, and software dependencies.

	2.6. Accurate asset classification and backend resource mapping offer numerous benefits, including:

		2.6.1. Efficient Resource Provisioning and Management: By understanding the resource requirements of assets and their dependencies, IT administrators can optimize resource allocation, anticipate resource demands, and ensure resource availability, leading to more efficient and cost-effective resource management.

		2.6.2. Cost Optimization and Resource Utilization: Granular insights into asset resource consumption and identification of underutilized or overprovisioned assets enable cost optimization strategies and resource utilization improvements.

		2.6.3. Effective Asset Lifecycle Management: Automated tracking of asset configurations, dependencies, and resource utilization patterns facilitates proactive maintenance, lifecycle planning, and end-of-lifecycle decommissioning.

		2.6.4. Empowered Self-Service Resource Portals and IaC: Automated asset classification and resource requirement validation empower self-service resource portals and IaC templates, enabling users to request and provision resources seamlessly and consistently.

		2.6.5. Data-Driven Asset-Based Machine Learning: Labeled data generated by the AST classifier supports the development of asset-based machine learning applications, enabling resource utilization prediction models, anomaly detection algorithms, and resource optimization strategies.

	2.7. The implementation of the AST classifier relies on a combination of natural language processing techniques, cloud computing terminology analysis tools, and machine learning algorithms. The classifier first extracts relevant features from the textual content associated with an asset or asset-related resource. These features may include asset descriptions, configuration details, backend resource requirements, and cloud computing-specific terminology. Next, the classifier analyzes the extracted features in the context of cloud architectures, resource management principles, and domain-specific usage patterns. Finally, the classifier employs machine learning algorithms to classify the asset or asset-related resource based on the combined textual, structural, contextual, and domain-specific features.

	2.8. The AST classifier offers several advantages over traditional asset classification methods:

		2.8.1. High Classification Accuracy: The classifier achieves high accuracy in classifying diverse asset types and their associated backend resource requirements, minimizing misclassifications and false positives.

		2.8.2. Deep Cloud Domain Expertise: The classifier incorporates deep cloud domain knowledge, enabling it to understand the nuances and complexities of asset configurations, resource consumption patterns, and cloud deployment environments.

		2.8.3. Context Awareness and Refined Classifications: The classifier considers the contextual information surrounding assets and their dependencies, providing more refined and contextually informed classifications.

		2.8.4. Adaptability to Evolving Cloud Technologies: The classifier can be adapted to new cloud platforms, services, and resource types, ensuring its effectiveness in dynamic cloud environments.
